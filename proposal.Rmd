Description of Communication and Work:
We have a GroupMe for general communications, and since all of us are in the same time zone we will have a weekly meeting with Google Hangouts or Zoom from 1pm to 2:30pm on Mondays, we will share documents using Google Drive.

Question:
What gender and age group are the most vulnerable to the coronavirus in the United States and how did they die?

Data Source: 
catalog.data.gov/dataset/provisional-covid-19-death-counts-by-sex-age-and-state/resource/5ca34364-d193-40e1-ae08-364ef0d8fb06

This dataset from the U.S government gives the number of people in a state that have died from coronavirus, as well as the breakdown by sex, age. In addition it gives the number of people that died from Influenza and Pneumonia. 

In addition to the first dataset we will also find datasets that give the total population and demographic breakdowns (age, sex) of each individual state to compare it against.

Summary of Methods:

Our plan right now is to make a bar graph with the different age groups and their susceptibility to Covid-19. We will also separate by sex and have two graphs in total.
We will use a binomial model to figure out the chance of a man versus a woman to catch coronavirus by state.
